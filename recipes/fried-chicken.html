      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy fried chicken. This is it! It's bits
        and pieces of hints I have heard
        over the years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method!</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients-list">
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="steps-container">
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer.</li>
        <li>
          Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour
          you
          use). 
        </li>
        <li>Season the flour with
          paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li>
        <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and
          shake to coat well.</li>
        <li>
          Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT
          UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A
          PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!
        </li>
        <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.</li>
        <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides.</li>
        <li>
          When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but
          not
          crispy). 
        </li>
        <li>Remove cover, raise
          heat again, and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
        <li>
          Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. 
        </li>
        <li>Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
      </ol>
